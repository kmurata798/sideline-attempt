Can't figure out why the explore page(displays the hobbies list) gives us the error message: "no such column as 'hobbies_hobbies.title'

Sideline works properly in this repository, but whenever we try to run it on our original repo, everything except the explore page works...

## How to use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run ```pipenv shell``` in the command line.
3. Run ```python3 manage.py runserver``` in the command line.
4. Copy paste URL provided into the search bar at the top of your internet browser.
